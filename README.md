# Official-Message



# Message Viewer
# Description
This repository contains a simple HTML page designed to display a message along with a question and corresponding GIF. The message is meant to be viewed on a laptop or PC. Additionally, JavaScript code has been included to enhance the functionality of the page, adding interactive features such as changing the message and GIF on button clicks, moving the "No" button on hover, preventing right-clicks, and hiding an additional wrapper.

# Features

Ask a question: "Can I work from home?"
Show a GIF related to the question.
Provide options to answer the question (Yes/No).
Change the displayed message and GIF when clicking the "Yes" button.
Move the "No" button to a random position within the window on hover.
Display an alert on attempting to right-click.
Hide a secondary wrapper and show the main wrapper on clicking a specific button.
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser, preferably on a laptop or PC.
Click the "Click to view" button to reveal Somnath's message.
Answer the question by clicking either the "Yes" or "No" button.
